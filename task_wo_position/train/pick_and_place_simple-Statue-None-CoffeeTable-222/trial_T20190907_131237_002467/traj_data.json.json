Since a shelf is not mentioned in the initial list of objects, we may assume there is a shelf in the room. Once the statue is placed on a shelf, it needs to be moved by the TV to the coffee table. Finally, a statue from a small table needs to be transferred to the coffee table in front of the couch."
