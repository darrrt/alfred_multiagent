    "explanation":"The objects required to complete the task are the DishSponge. The first step involves placing a newly rinsed off sponge into the tub, which would involve one of the DishSponges. The next step is to wash the green sponge from the tub and put it back, which also involves one of the DishSponges. Finally, putting a wet sponge in the tub requires the other DishSponge."
