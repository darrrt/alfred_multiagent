    "explanation":"To complete the task of putting a bowl with a pencil in it on a dresser, we need to first pick up the bowl and pencil. Then, we need to locate the dresser and place the bowl with the pencil in it on the dresser. If we want to put the bowl and pencil on a TV stand instead, we can pick up the bowl and pencil, locate the TV stand, and place the bowl and pencil on the TV stand. If we are asked to move a bowl and pencil to a dresser, we need to pick up the bowl and pencil, locate the dresser, and move the bowl and pencil to the dresser."
