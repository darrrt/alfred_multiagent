To throw away the soap that is on top of the toilet, we will need to identify which soap object is on top of the toilet (either SoapBar or SoapBottle). Finally, to put a soap in the trash, we will need either the SoapBar or SoapBottle. The other objects in the environment are not relevant to completing the task."
