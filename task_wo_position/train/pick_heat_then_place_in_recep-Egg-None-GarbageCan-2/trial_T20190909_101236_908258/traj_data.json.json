    "explanation":"To complete the task of placing a heated egg in the garbage, we may need to use a ladle to remove the egg from the hot water (pot). Then we can transfer the egg to a plate using a spatula. After the egg has been heated, we can discard the plate with the egg into the garbage. Additionally, we may need to wash the pan used to heat the egg, so the pan may also be involved in the execution steps."
