    "explanation":"To place a statue on the TV stand, we will need to select the statue and the TV stand from the objects listed in the environment. The TV stand is not explicitly listed, but it is a common furniture item that would likely be present in the environment. We will need to physically move the selected statue from its current location to the TV stand, ensuring that it is placed securely and aesthetically on top of the stand."
