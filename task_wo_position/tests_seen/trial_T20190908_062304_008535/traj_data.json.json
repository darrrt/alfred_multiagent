    "explanation":"The task involves using a plate to sterilize it by heating it - hence the Plate is required. The Plate is then put in the drawer. The Plate is then microwaved, so the Microwave is needed. The Plate is then placed in the Refrigerator before moving it to a Cabinet next to the Microwave. Additionally, a Saucer is required for microwaving and then putting it in a Cabinet."
